          <h3>Counter Strike</h3>
          <p>
              I would rather count it as emotion rather than my skill because it is too close to my heart from my childhood. Introduced by my elder brother I played Counter strike from its oldest version. I remember one quote from this video game whenever I feel low, that is, <br>
            "This is a bandit country, shoot everything that moves...."
